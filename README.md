THERE ARE LIKE A thousand things wrong with just moving the pieces

after the first moves the queens are not able to move

other sliding pieces are unable to move



///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

eval issues:
king is primarily the one moving
Black pieces pick illogical decisions
    
issues with minmax:
the black king positions sometimes seems to be removed from the list even though it was the best move
if the black king is in check, it seems as if the white king is in check as well


issues with move gen:

fix func and style of all code later
