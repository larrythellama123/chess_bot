issues 

if the black king is in check, it seems as if the white king is in check as well
eval function needs tweaking:
    king will move even though there are ez pickins
    king is




issues with move gen:

make the code more efficient to run at depth of 4
force king to corner


recurring issues:
self.check_for_captures results in rechecking of the same moves
unable to do a smooth 4 step ahead bot
the king is still being chosen as the primary move sometimes
